You can dump your files which are stored in the specified directory, or put dumped files into any path under your vault.


Note: Since v0.0.7, We can use properties to control this plug-in!

### How to use

#### Install
You can install Screwdriver ... 
- From Community Plugins
- Via [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat).

#### Prepare a dump command file

The dump command file is the file which has some directions on the frontmatter; like the following.

```yaml
targets:
  - .obsidian/plugins/tagfolder
urls: []
ignores:
  - /node_modules
  - /.git
filters:
  - main\.js$
  - manifest\.json$
  - styles\.css$
comment: "'Add target directory' to add targets"
tags: []
```
However, we do not have to worry so much. We can make this file by `Ctrl+P` -> `Screwdriver: Create dump template` on the empty file.

Then, all we have to do is simply pick the target directory, by `Ctrl+P` -> `Screwdriver: Add target directory`. (For plugins).

For other things, please change the `filters` and `ignores`.
- `Ignores`: files beginning with the letter set here will be omitted while dumping.
- `Filters`: only the files that match with the expression set here will be dumped.

Note: If `URLs` have been supplied, we can retrieve the files from the internet. It may be useful for fetching CSS Snippets from Gist.
